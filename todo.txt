need to handle different max and min with 6dot
percent of max needs to take into account minimum rolls as well

Need to think about command nesting


gp takes no arguments. What should I do if somebody supplies some?

guild['chatChannel1Id']????

reformat user gp growth. Can any of the guild code be reused? need to handle data larger than max messages size
